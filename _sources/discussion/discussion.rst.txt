The **Five-Star Battery Data** framework is not just a technical concept—it is a community effort. Its impact grows as more researchers adopt open practices, share metadata-rich datasets, and collaborate across institutions and disciplines.

This section provides a space for reflection and discussion. Here we highlight the experiences of students, researchers, and practitioners who have applied the Five-Star Battery Data principles in real projects. Their insights help illustrate:

- what aspects of the framework were most valuable,
- where they encountered challenges,
- how the transition to open, structured, linked data changed their workflow,
- and what opportunities they see for the future of battery data.

The video below features a group discussion where students share their perspectives on adopting Five-Star Battery Data in their own research settings.
