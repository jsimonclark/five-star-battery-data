    "# ★ 1-Star Battery Data\n",

    "\n",

    "In the 5-Star Battery Data framework, 1-star data is:\n",
    "- Published to a public repository (e.g., Zenodo), and\n",
    "- Assigned a clear, permissive license for reuse (e.g., CC-BY 4.0)\n",

    "## What is a public repository?  \n",
    "A public repository is an open-access platform where research data can be deposited, described, and shared with others. It ensures that your dataset is openly accessible, citable, and preserved long-term by assigning a persistent identifier such as a DOI. Public repositories require key descriptive metadata—including title, abstract, keywords, licensing, and creator information—formatted in a machine-readable way to support indexing and reuse.\n",
    "Platforms like Zenodo support these features natively and allow metadata enrichment with identifiers such as ORCID (for authors) and ROR (for institutions), promoting clarity and credit attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is this important?  \n",
    "Publishing your data in a public repository significantly increases its visibility, trustworthiness, and impact. A persistent identifier ensures others can reliably cite your dataset, while the repository guarantees long-term access and preservation. By including rich, standardized metadata, your dataset becomes easier to find, integrate, and reuse within research infrastructures, knowledge graphs, and semantic search tools—supporting the broader goals of open science and FAIR data.\n",

    "## What we will do  \n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. **Load** your Zenodo Sandbox access token securely from a `.env` file\n",

    "3. **Create** a deposition in the Zenodo Sandbox via the API\n",
    "4. **Upload** a structured `.csv` battery data file\n",
    "5. **Publish** the dataset and obtain a shareable DOI-like URL\n",

    "## What is the Zenodo Sandbox?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zenodo Sandbox is a publicly available test server that mimics the real Zenodo publishing platform. It allows you to safely practice uploading datasets, registering metadata, and minting DOIs—without affecting the live site or making anything publicly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can upload data in two ways:\n",
    "- Via the web interface – a user-friendly option ideal for one-time or manual uploads.  \n",
    "- Via the API – a powerful method for automating uploads, especially useful when publishing many datasets or integrating Zenodo into your data processing pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the web interface is convenient, setting up a pipeline through the API is much more efficient and scalable for frequent or large-volume uploads. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the API. \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Access Token and Why Do I Need One?\n",
    "An access token is like a digital key that lets your code talk to Zenodo on your behalf. Instead of logging in with a username and password, you use this token to securely connect to Zenodo’s system—especially when using automated tools or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells Zenodo who you are and what you're allowed to do, such as:  \n",
    "- Uploading files  \n",
    "- Editing metadata  \n",
    "- Publishing or updating records\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essential when using the Zenodo Sandbox API to automate your data publishing workflow. Without an access token, Zenodo won’t know who’s making the request or whether they have permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Create an Access Token\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the API, you need a personal **access token** to authenticate your requests. Here’s how to create one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://sandbox.zenodo.org](https://sandbox.zenodo.org) and sign in (you may need to register an account).\n",
    "2. Click your profile icon and choose **Applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](img/zenodo_sandbox_applications.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click **New Token**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](img/zenodo_sandbox_new_token.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Give it a name like `\"five_star_data_test_token\"`.\n",
    "5. Enable the following scopes:\n",
    "   - `deposit:write` (upload new data)\n",
    "   - `deposit:actions` (publish data)\n",
    "   - `user:email` (optional, to identify yourself)\n",
    "6. Click **Create** and copy the generated token.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](img/zenodo_sandbox_create_token.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Access Token\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep your token secure, you should store it in a `.env` file rather than hardcoding it into this notebook. Open the ```.env``` file that accompanies this notebook and paste your token into the following field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```env\n",
    "ZENODO_SANDBOX_TOKEN=paste_your_sandbox_token_here\n",
