# Five-Star Battery Data MOOC

Welcome to the source repository for the **Five-Star Battery Data** MOOC — a self-paced course designed to help researchers, developers, and data stewards make battery data more open, structured, and machine-actionable.

## About the Course

Battery data is often underutilized due to poor accessibility, lack of structure, and missing metadata. This course teaches you how to apply modern data practices — inspired by the Semantic Web, FAIR principles, and linked data — to transform raw measurements into reusable research assets.

The course follows the **Five-Star Battery Data** framework:

1. ⭐ Publish your data on the web with a permissive license  
2. ⭐⭐ Use structured data (e.g., tables, JSON)  
3. ⭐⭐⭐ Use open formats (e.g., `.csv`, `.json`, `.parquet`)  
4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Describe your data with ontologies  
5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Link your data to other relevant resources
